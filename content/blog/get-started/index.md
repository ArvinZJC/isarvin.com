Here's a late Spring Festival celebration from the new blogger. Yes, it's me. <mark>Wish us a prosperous and joyful Year of the Snake!</mark> 🐍

I have published my personal site in the late 2021. At almost the same time, I planned to start blogging. Unfortunately, it comes true today, after over 3 years. Since I know I'm way late on the blogging journey, I would like to share several reasons here as follows.

- Procrastination. Definitely! 🙄
- Tired of social media sharing. Maybe a reflection of being an introvert? 👀
- A stronger will to **record** guides, ideas, and thoughts. Never too late to learn; never too late to blog. 🤠

You might notice I put "record" rather than "share". I would be glad if my blog could assist you. I don't mean to tell or even teach some kind of correct/great/popular things or whatever. But mostly, I try exploring an interesting way to take notes. That is, my 1st priority, at least for now, is to occasionally share with my future self.

So when to update next time? 💆‍♂️
